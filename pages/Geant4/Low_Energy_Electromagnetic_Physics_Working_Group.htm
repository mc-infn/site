<p>The Geant4 Low Energy Electromagnetic Physics Working Group develops and maintains sets of processes and models to describe the electromagnetic interactions of photons, electrons, positrons, hadrons and ions with matter down to very low energies (eV scale), including the Geant4-DNA project, initiated by the European Space Agency.
</p><p>
Applications of such processes and models range from high energy physics to space science and bio-medical applications.
</p><p>
  These activities take place in full collaboration with the Standard Electromagnetic Physics Working Group of the Geant4 collaboration.
