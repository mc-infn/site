<b>26-31 May 2019
  Hotel Porto Conte (Alghero)</b>
</p><p>
This event is organized by INFN, University of Sassari and by the Centro Siciliano di Fisica Nucleare e Struttura della Materia. The Seminar offers lectures to Ph.D. students, medical physicists and young researchers working at Universities or Research Institutes.
</p><p>
The Seminar is organized in didactic units on software developed and used in fundamental and applied physics.
</p><p>
The lectures also include a full official basic course on the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. Lectures will cover all aspects of the toolkit from basic installation through advanced topics and will be interspersed with examples that build a progressively more complex application, extensible to real space and medical use.
On the last day of the School, students will have the opportunity to test their learning achievements through a written exam. The successful outcome of the test will be reported on a written certificate for those interested, to be requested on arrival, at the registration desk. A simple attendance certificate will also be available on request.
